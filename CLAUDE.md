# CLAUDE.md — Project Brain

## North Star
I'm building a quote collection for community so that we can save and revisit quotes that inspire or resonate with everyone.

## Current Milestone
- [x] Hello World (repo working, can push to GitHub) ✅
- [ ] MVP (live on GitHub Pages with a working quote collection)

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla, no framework)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Version control with Git/GitHub

## How to Run
- Local: Open index.html in browser
- Live: [GitHub Pages URL - will add once deployed]

## Current Status - WHERE WE STOPPED (Dec 25, 2024)
**Completed:**
- ✅ Step 1-3: Environment setup complete
- ✅ Step 4: Project brainstormed - Quote Collection
- ✅ Step 5: GitHub setup and first repository created
- ✅ Step 6: Hello World webpage created with Einstein quote

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 Step 7: Enable GitHub Pages (NEXT STEP)
  - Need to enable GitHub Pages to make site live
  - CLI command didn't work (--enable-pages flag not available)
  - Next attempt: Use GitHub API via CLI or web UI

## Next 3 Steps
1. Enable GitHub Pages (Step 7 - IN PROGRESS)
2. Verify site is live and accessible from phone
3. Add more quotes and interactive features (Step 8)

## Decisions Made
- Starting with a simple static site (no database) - easy to deploy and maintain
- Using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) - keeps it simple for learning
- Focusing on display first, will add features like search/categories later

## What I Learned Today (Dec 25, 2024)
- Completed environment setup (Node.js, Claude Code, VS Code, Git, GitHub CLI)
- Created Projects folder structure
- Learned basic terminal commands
- Defined project goal and North Star statement
- Set up Git repository and made first commit
- Pushed code to GitHub successfully
- Learned what commits are (snapshots of project state)
- Created first HTML webpage with CSS styling
- Added first quote (Einstein) to the page
- Opened webpage locally in browser
- Repository live at: https://github.com/notAIbot/launchpad
- Enterprise GitHub accounts have restrictions (can't create public repos)

## Known Issues
- None yet - just getting started!

## Project Scope (MVP)
- Display a collection of quotes with authors
- Clean, readable design
- Easy to add new quotes by editing a data file

## Future Ideas (Not for MVP)
- Search/filter by author or keyword
- Random quote button
- Categories/tags
- Favorite quotes feature
