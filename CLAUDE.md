# CLAUDE.md — Project Brain

## North Star
I'm building a quote collection for community so that we can save and revisit quotes that inspire or resonate with everyone.

## Current Milestone
- [x] Hello World (repo working, can push to GitHub) ✅
- [ ] MVP (live on GitHub Pages with a working quote collection)

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla, no framework)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Version control with Git/GitHub

## How to Run
- Local: Open index.html in browser
- Live: [GitHub Pages URL - will add once deployed]

## Next 3 Steps
1. Create a simple "Hello World" webpage (index.html)
2. Enable GitHub Pages and see it live
3. Add basic quote display functionality

## Decisions Made
- Starting with a simple static site (no database) - easy to deploy and maintain
- Using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) - keeps it simple for learning
- Focusing on display first, will add features like search/categories later

## What I Learned Today
- Completed environment setup (Node.js, Claude Code, VS Code, Git, GitHub CLI)
- Created Projects folder structure
- Learned basic terminal commands
- Defined project goal and North Star statement
- Set up Git repository and made first commit
- Pushed code to GitHub successfully
- Learned what commits are (snapshots of project state)
- Repository live at: https://github.com/notAIbot/launchpad

## Known Issues
- None yet - just getting started!

## Project Scope (MVP)
- Display a collection of quotes with authors
- Clean, readable design
- Easy to add new quotes by editing a data file

## Future Ideas (Not for MVP)
- Search/filter by author or keyword
- Random quote button
- Categories/tags
- Favorite quotes feature
